# PFW_ChatBot

CS59000-03 Group Project for Course

## Motivation:
> Purdue Fort Wayne doesn't have a chatbot right now. The current process is to communicate/post queries to relevant people using existing coimmunication channels. This leads usually to ask a lot of FAQs, which becomes repetative at some point.

## Goal:
> * The current idea is to design this chatbot in the scope of PFW CS Department only.
> * Good enough performance.
> * Quick response with even quicker turn around time.
> * Should be accurate.
